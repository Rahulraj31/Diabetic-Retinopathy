# Diabetic-Retinopathy 
 I did this project on two same but different  datasets. The difference between the datasets were the quality of images in the dataset : 224x224 and 1024x1024. Better image quality results in better accuracy.

## About The Data
The images consist of retina scan images to detect diabetic retinopathy. The original dataset is available at APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection. These images are resized into 224x224 pixels so that they can be readily used with many pre-trained deep learning models.

All of the images are already saved into their respective folders according to the severity/stage of diabetic retinopathy using the train.csv file provided. You will find five directories with the respective images:

- 0 - No_DR
- 1 - Mild
- 2 - Moderate
- 3 - Severe
- 4 - Proliferate_DR
